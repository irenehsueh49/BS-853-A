# Framingham-Study-Analysis
For my SPH BS 853 (Generalized Linear Models with Applications) final project, I examined association between incidence of heart disease with cholesterol levels and smoking using data collected on the Framingham Study population. You can read my [full report](https://github.com/irenehsueh49/Framingham-Study-Analysis/blob/main/Framingham%20Report.pdf) and view my [presentation](https://github.com/irenehsueh49/Framingham-Study-Analysis/blob/main/Framingham%20Presentation.pdf) in this repository. Feel free to contact me at irenehsueh49@gmail.com with any questions about my code!
